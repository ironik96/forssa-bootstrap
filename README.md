# Forssa Training Exercise

The exercise was supposed to be done using bootstrap but I feel like I deviated from it. Don't mind the naming of the css classes or how it was done, I really didn't care about the code, just wanted to finish the task and get done with it.

<div style="text-align:center;margin-top:40px;"><img src="images/meme.png" alt="bootstrap meme" width="400px"></div>
